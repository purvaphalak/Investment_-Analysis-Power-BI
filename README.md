 ### ‚û°Ô∏è Objective of the Project: 
 
‚û§ The objective of this investment analysis project is to use Power BI to explore and understand various investment behaviors. 

‚û§ This includes analyzing key statistics, gender-based differences, and the relationship between savings goals and investment choices. 

‚û§ The project also aims to identify common reasons for investing and the sources of investment information, all of which will be summarized in a comprehensive, interactive dashboard.


### Tools 

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- PowerBI- Creating Dashboards, Data Visualization

 ### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting


 ### ‚û°Ô∏è Steps I Followed:
 
#### 1)  Data Explorization and Summary:

##### ‚ú§ Data Import: 
I began by importing the dataset into Power BI. This powerful tool allowed me to efficiently handle and analyze the data.

##### ‚ú§ Exploratory Analysis: 
I then explored the dataset to understand its structure and data types. This step was crucial to identify key variables and ensure accurate analysis.

##### ‚ú§ Calculate Statistics: 
Using the insights from the exploratory phase, I computed essential metrics such as average age, the percentage of individuals with various investments, and common savings objectives. These statistics provided a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics.


#### 2) Gender-based Analysis:

##### ‚ú§ Visualization: 
To effectively communicate the findings, I created a series of insightful charts. These visualizations made the data more accessible and easier to interpret.

#####  ‚ú§ Visual Comparison:
‚û£  I created comprehensive charts using Power BI to compare investment choices such as equity, mutual funds, and government bonds based on gender.

‚û£ Used Clustered column chart and stacked column charts to highlight the investment distribution among male and female investors.

#### 3) Objective Analysis:

##### ‚ú§ Correlation Analysis: 
Explored the correlations between various savings objectives (like Capital Appreciation, Retirement Planning) and investment avenues (such as Equity, Mutual Funds, Government Bonds) using correlation matrices and scatter plots in Power BI.

##### ‚ú§ Chart Creation: 
Developed insightful visualization including Clustered column chart to clearly display the preferred investment choices for each savings objective.


#### 4) Investment Duration & Frequency:

##### ‚ú§ Duration Distribution: 
I visualized the distribution of investment durations using bar charts in Power BI. This helped in identifying that the majority of investors prefer medium-term investments (1-5 years), with the highest number of investments falling in the 3-5 year category.

##### ‚ú§ Frequency Analysis: 
I analyzed investment monitoring frequencies through bar charts. The findings revealed that most investors monitor their investments on a monthly basis. I then examined how this monitoring frequency impacts their investment choices.


#### 5) Reasons of Investment:

##### ‚ú§ Trend Analysis:
Identified common reasons for investment, such as Better Returns, Fund Diversification, and Tax Benefits.
Analyzed the dataset to find patterns and frequencies of these reasons.

##### ‚ú§Visualization:
Created detailed charts in Power BI to display the distribution and frequency of investment reasons.
Visualized how investment durations and monitoring frequencies vary by reason.


#### 6)  Source of Information :

##### ‚ú§ Source Analysis:
Compiled data on various information sources such as Newspapers, Internet, Financial Advisors, and Friends/Family.
Cleaned and organized the data for accurate analysis.

##### ‚ú§ Visualization:
Created informative bar and pie charts in Power BI to represent the frequency and proportion of each information source.
These visuals highlight the most commonly relied upon sources by investors.


 ### ‚û°Ô∏è Insights of the project :-

#### 1)  Data Explorization and Summary:

‚û§ The average age of individuals in the dataset is around 28 years, with a majority being male investors (62.5%). 

‚û§ Gold and Debentures are the most popular investment choices, followed closely by Government Bonds. 

‚û§ Retirement planning is the primary savings objective for most individuals, followed by health care and education. 

‚û§ The investment distribution shows that over 20% of individuals prefer Gold and Debentures, indicating a preference for relatively safer investment options. 

‚û§ Overall, the data highlights a young investor demographic with a focus on long-term financial security.


#### 2) Gender-based Analysis:

##### ‚û§ Gender Differences: 
Clear differences in investment preferences were identified, providing valuable insights into how investment strategies might be tailored for different genders.

##### ‚û§ Balanced Portfolios: 
Female investors tended to have more balanced portfolios, highlighting potential risk management strategies.


#### 3) Objective Analysis:

##### ‚û§ Capital Appreciation: 
Investors looking for capital appreciation prefer equities, showing a strong correlation between high-risk, high-reward investments.

##### ‚û§ Growth: 
There is a balanced distribution among equities, fixed deposits, mutual funds, and public provident funds, with a slight preference for mutual funds, indicating a diversified approach for growth objectives.

##### ‚û§ Income: 
Inclination towards secure investments like public provident funds, while still considering equities for higher returns.


#### 4) Investment Duration & Frequency:

##### ‚û§ Medium-Term Preference: 
Investors predominantly prefer holding their investments for 3-5 years.

##### ‚û§ Monthly Monitoring: 
The majority of investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, which appears to be a common strategy for managing medium-term investments.


#### 5) Reasons of Investment:

‚û§ Better Returns is the dominant reason for investment, indicating that investors are primarily motivated by high potential gains.

‚û§ Fund Diversification is also a significant reason, suggesting that investors are interested in spreading their risks across various assets.

‚û§ Tax Benefits is the least common reason, implying it is not a primary motivator for most investors in the dataset.

##### üí†Investment Duration:
‚û§ The majority of investments, regardless of reason, are held for 3-5 years.

‚û§ A significant portion also prefers a 1-3 year duration.

‚û§ Very few investors hold investments for less than 1 year or more than 5 years.

##### üí†Monitoring Frequency:
‚û§ Most investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, indicating a preference for regular but not overly frequent oversight.

‚û§ Weekly and daily monitoring are less common, suggesting these are either less necessary or less feasible for most investors.


#### 6)  Source of Information :

#### üí†Source by Avenue :

##### 1. Mutual Funds:
ñßπ The most common source of information for mutual funds is financial consultants, with 18 mentions.
ñßπ This indicates that investors heavily rely on professional advice when it comes to mutual funds.

##### 2. Equity:
ñßπ Equity investments also see a significant reliance on financial consultants, with 10 mentions.
ñßπ This shows a trend where professional advice is sought for high-risk investments.

##### 3. Fixed Deposits:
ñßπ Information for fixed deposits is primarily gathered from financial consultants (9 mentions).
ñßπ This suggests that even for relatively safer investments, professional advice is preferred.

##### 4. Public Provident Fund:
ñßπ The least mentioned source, with only 3 mentions, indicating lower reliance or interest in this avenue among the sampled investors.

#### üí† Avenue by Source :

##### 1. Financial Consultants:
ñßπ Financial consultants are the leading source of information, with 16 mentions.
ñßπ This underscores the importance of professional advice in investment decisions.

##### 2. Newspapers and Magazines:
ñßπ Traditional media is the second most common source, with 14 mentions.
ñßπ This highlights that despite the rise of digital media, traditional sources still play a significant role in providing investment information.

##### 3. Television:
ñßπ Television comes in third, with 6 mentions.
ñßπ This suggests that broadcast media is also a key player in influencing investment decisions, though less so than print media and financial consultants.

##### 4. Internet:
ñßπ Surprisingly, the internet is the least mentioned source, with only 4 mentions.
ñßπ This could indicate either a lesser reliance on online sources or a preference for more trusted, traditional forms of information.


### Summary :

##### ñßπ Professional Advice Dominates: 
Financial consultants are the most trusted source across all investment avenues, indicating a high value placed on expert opinion.

##### ñßπ Traditional Media is Key: 
Newspapers and magazines are still highly relevant, showing the enduring influence of print media.

##### ñßπ Digital Media Lagging: 
Despite the global shift towards digitalization, the internet is the least relied upon source, which could highlight a trust gap or a demographic preference towards more traditional sources.
